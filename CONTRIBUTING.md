   - Background → `assets/imgs/char/back/<char_name>.webp`
   - Banner → `assets/imgs/char/name/<char_name>.webp`

2. Ensure lowercase for alphabetical characters and underscores for special 
   characters while naming the static assets

3. Update resource binaries in accordance with the newly added static resources
   and generate them in the `QRC` format
   ```bash
   (venv) $ nano assets/back.qrc
   (venv) $ nano assets/face.qrc
   (venv) $ nano assets/name.qrc
   (venv) $ nano assets/wish.qrc

  (venv) $ tox
  ```

- The quality checks can be executed using the following command.
  ```bash
  (venv) $ tox -e cleaning
  ```

- The functionality tests can be executed using the following command.
  ```bash
  (venv) $ tox -e py<python-vers>
  ```
